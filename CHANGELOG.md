## How to Write Changelog Entries

When you make changes, add entries under `[Unreleased]` following these guidelines:

- **Added** for new features

- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** for now removed features
- **Fixed** for any bug fixes

When you release a new version:

1. Rename `[Unreleased]` to `[VERSION] — DATE` (e.g., `[1.1.0] — 2026-06-20`)
2. Add a new `[Unreleased]` section at the top
3. Update version in `manifest.json`
4. Commit and tag: `git tag v1.1.0`

Example:
```markdown
## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- New `multiply` capability

### Fixed
